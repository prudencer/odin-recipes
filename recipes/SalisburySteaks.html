    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until evenly mixed.<br> 
            Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth,<br>
             onion, and mushrooms; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until patties are no longer pink<br>
              in the center, about 10 minutes more. Transfer patties to a platter and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Bring onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook and stir<br>
             until onion gravy is thickened, about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve.</li>
